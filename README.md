# Simple To-Do app utilizing a dockerized C# API + SQL Server database
- The goal of this project is for me to familiarize myself more with C# and SQL Server by buildling a simple To-Do app.
- I am using copilot to help me learn and understand the language, and will not be focusing on security initially.

# Goals:
- Get basic API + DB functional (including setup script)
    - Just basic GET/POST/DELETE for each TODO item
- Add filtering for TODO items
- Build a test framework
- Build a basic frontend
- Security overhaul?
