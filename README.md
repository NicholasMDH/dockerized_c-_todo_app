# Simple To-Do app utilizing a dockerized C# API + SQL Server database
- The goal of this project is for me to familiarize myself more with C# and SQL Server by buildling a simple To-Do app.
- I am using copilot to help me learn and understand the language, and will not be focusing on security initially.

# Documentation
I was keeping all of my documentation in a separate markdown document so I just copied it over to `Documentation.md`

# Goals:
- Get basic API + DB functional (including setup script) - DONE!
- Build a test framework
- Build a basic frontend
    - Add filtering for TODO items
- Security overhaul?
